# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage you to let us know right away.

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

To privately disclose a security vulnerability, create a security advisory in the affected repository by visiting the `Advisories` section under the `Security` tab.

:warning: **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
